User Information Form
This project implements a User Information Form that collects user details such as name, email, date of birth, phone, address, city, state, ZIP code, and country. The form includes additional features such as dark/light mode toggle, table display of submitted data, and basic input validation.

Features
Dark/Light Mode: A toggle button to switch between dark and light themes.
Date Picker: A flatpickr date picker for the Date of Birth field.
Form Validation: Required fields with validation for each form input.
Submit Button: Submits user information and adds it to a table.
Clear Button: Clears all form fields.
Search Button: Placeholder for future search functionality.
Sort Button: Placeholder for future sorting functionality.
Table View: Displays submitted user information with options for future actions like edit or delete.


Technologies Used
HTML: Basic structure and form elements.
CSS: Custom styles for layout and theming.
Font Awesome: Icons used for buttons.
Flatpickr: Datepicker for selecting the date of birth.
JavaScript: Handles form submission, clearing, and theme switching.


How It Works
Form Input: The user fills out the form with required fields like name, email, date of birth, phone, and address details.
Form Validation: Once the form is submitted, the fields are validated for required inputs.
Data Submission: Upon successful validation, the user data is displayed in a table below the form.
Actions: The table provides a place to display the user's submitted data with placeholders for edit, delete, and search actions.
Dark/Light Mode Toggle
The Dark Mode and Light Mode can be toggled using the button in the upper-right corner.
The default mode is Light Mode, and it can be switched to Dark Mode for a darker theme.
To Do
Implement the Search functionality to search through the submitted user data in the table.
Implement Sorting functionality to sort the table based on different fields (e.g., Name, Email, Date of Birth).
Add edit and delete actions in the table for modifying or removing submitted entries.
